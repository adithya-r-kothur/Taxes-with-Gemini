              Long-term capital gains (LTCG) apply to assets held for more than a year and are taxed at a lower rate (10% for equities). Short-term capital gains (STCG) apply to assets held for less than a year and are taxed at your applicable income tax slab rate. Reinvesting LTCG in specific assets can help you defer or save on taxes.
